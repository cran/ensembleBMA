\title{
  Precipitation Data over 10 Days
}
\description{
 A 741 by 7 matrix of precipitation forecasts, observations and dates
 over 10 days. The first 5 columns are the forecasts from the ensemble
 members. The observed presipitation is in the 6th column, and the
 dates of the forecasts and observations are in the 7th column.
}

\details{
 This is a subset of daily 48 hour forecasts of 24 hour accumulated 
 precipitation over the US Pacific Northwest region in 2003-2004 based 
 on the 9 member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble
(Grimmit and Mass 2002; Eckel and Mass 2005). \\
 This reduced data set is used in the help file examples in the interest
 speed; in practice longer training periods and more data would be needed
 for good forecasting.
