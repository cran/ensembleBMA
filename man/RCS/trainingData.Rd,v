\title{
    Training data for a given date and training rule.
}
\description{
  Extracts the training data corresponding to a given date and training rule.
}
\usage{
trainingData( ensembleData, date, trainingRule = list(length=30, lag=2)) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{ensembleData}{
     An \code{ensembleData} object including ensemble forecasts, observations 
     and dates of precipitation. 
  }
  \item{date}{
     The date for which the training data is desired. 
  }
  \item{trainingRule}{
     A list giving the \code{length} and \code{lag} for the training period.
     The default is to use a 30 day training period for a forecast
     2 days ahead of the last day in the training period.
  }
}
\value{
An \code{ensembleData} object corresponding to the training data for
the given date relative to \code{ensembleData}.
}
\details{
  The training rule uses the most recent days for the given period
  regardless of whether or not they are consecutive.
