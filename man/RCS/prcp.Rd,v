  Precipitation Data Set
}
\description{
 This is a subset of daily 48 hour forecasts of 24 hour accumulated 
 precipitation over the US Pacific Northwest region in 2003-2004 based 
 on the 9 member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble
(Grimit and Mass 2002; Eckel and Mass 2005). \cr
}
\format{
A data frame with 279 rows and 15 columns. The columns are: \cr
CENT        - forecasts from the CENT member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
AVN         - forecasts from the AVN member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
CMCG        - forecasts from the CMCG member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
ETA         - forecasts from the ETA member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
GASP        - forecasts from the GASP member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
JMA         - forecasts from the JMA member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
NGAPS       - forecasts from the NGAPS member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
TCWB        - forecasts from the TCWB member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
UKMO        - forecasts from the UKMO member of the ensemble (numeric). \cr
observation - the observed sea-level pressure (numeric). 
date        - the date of each forecast/observation set, \cr
              in the format YYYYMMDDHH (categorical). \cr
station     - weather station identifier (categorical). \cr
latitude    - the latitude of each weather station (numeric). \cr
longitude   - the longitude of each weather station (numeric). \cr
elevation   - the elevation of each weather station (numeric). 
}

\details{
This dataset is a small subset of the data used in Sloughter et al. (2006),
provided for the purposes of testing. Typically forecasting would be
performed on much larger datasets.
